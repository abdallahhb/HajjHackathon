						Due to the need of the health centers in the Kingdom of information pilgrims medical and caused many of the pilgrims themselves to some of the problems of ignorance of some of them and the customs and organizational matters of the pilgrims
					The Smart Haj Service application comes in an effort to cover this gap by creating a personal page containing the medical pilgrim's information and the list of vaccinations he has taken. This comes before his arrival in the holy sites in order to avoid overcrowding in the Holy Bekaa as much as possible
					In addition to the Hajj training file, which indicates that Hajj passed the International Pilgrimage Testing System (IHTS)
					International Hajj test system, which is established by the body charged with Hajj, which qualifies the owner to perform Hajj
